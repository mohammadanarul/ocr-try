Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology is designed to recognize printed or handwritten text from digital images, such as scanned paper documents, photos, or PDFs, and convert them into machine-readable text. This technology is especially useful for digitizing printed materials, making them searchable, editable, and easy to share.
